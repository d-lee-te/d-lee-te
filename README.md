## Hey there! ✨
I'm David, and this is my github page!

🎓 I'm a graduate from Georgia Tech with a B.S. in CS.

Specifically, I graduated with specializations (aka threads 🧵) in Devices and Intelligence!

### Here, you'll see:
- [My personal website](https://d-lee-te.github.io/) (which is currently being hosted on gitpages for now)
- Personal projects
  - I've been absolutely obsessed with helping build out the front-end of [the meep stats site](https://github.com/dpvb/meep-site)! (click the cats!)
- Some of my old school assignments, projects, and classes with most of it redacted or omitted and replaced with synopses (I made the actual code private)

### Currently
Still working on [this](https://github.com/dpvb/meep-site), but I have a few other ideas for building out an inhouse tournament website w/ a discord bot as an additional interface.

It's between that and building some kind of run tool for Risk of Rain 2, but all down the pipeline of things to build :D

Feel free to contact me! ✉️
