## Hey there! ✨
I'm David, and this is my github page!

🎓 I'm a graduate from Georgia Tech with a B.S. in CS.

Specifically, I graduated with specializations (aka threads 🧵) in Devices and Intelligence!

### Here, you'll see:
- [My personal website](https://www.dleete.dev/) and [the repo](https://github.com/d-lee-te/d-lee-te-website/tree/main)
- Personal projects
  - I've been absolutely obsessed with helping build out the front-end of [the meep stats site](https://github.com/dpvb/meep-site)! (click the cats!)
- Some of my old school assignments, projects, and classes with most of it redacted or omitted and replaced with synopses (I made the actual code private)

### Currently:
Still working on [this](https://github.com/dpvb/meep-site) a little bit, but I've start working on a League of Legends stat tool, but I can't make that repo public yet until I get my personal api key :D

Feel free to contact me! ✉️
