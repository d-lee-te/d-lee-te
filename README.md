## Hey there! ✨
I'm David, and this is my github page!

🎓 I'm a graduate from Georgia Tech with a B.A. in CS.

Specifically, I graduated with specializations (aka threads 🧵) in Devices and Intelligence!

### Here, you'll see:
- [My personal website](https://d-lee-te.github.io/) (which is currently being hosted on gitpages for now)
- Personal projects
- Some of my old school assignments and projects with most of it redacted or omitted and replaced with synopses (I made the actual code private)

Feel free to contact me ✉️!
